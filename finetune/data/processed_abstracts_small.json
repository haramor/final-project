    "This study was conducted to determine the effects of family planning education given to married illiterate women of reproductive age via visual material support on their family planning attitudes and contraceptive preferences. METHOD: The randomized controlled study was carried out between 31 January and 31 July 2023. The sample of the study consisted of 148 women, including 74 in the experimental group and 74 in the control group. Using a Family Planning Education Booklet prepared for illiterate women, an education program lasting a week in total was held in three sessions. No intervention was made in the control group. Data were collected using a Personal Information Form, a Family Planning Assessment Form, and the Family Planning Attitude Scale. After the intervention, the Family Planning Attitude Scale total and subscale scores of the participants were significantly higher in the experimental group compared to both their pretest scores and the posttest scores of the control group (pÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.001). There was an increase in the rates of participants who preferred modern and effective family planning methods in the experimental group after the education program. All participants in the experimental group stated that they were satisfied with the education given within the scope of the study. The family planning education program provided to women using educational content prepared for illiterate women was effective in increasing the knowledge and positive attitudes of the women regarding family planning.

    "Data were collected in Ukraine in 2020 as part of the People Living with HIV Stigma Index 2.0, led by 100% Life, the largest organisation for people living with HIV in Eastern Europe/Central Asia. WLHIV were recruited throughout Ukraine through limited chain referral and venue-based sampling. All participants completed a sociobehavioural questionnaire. Self-reported outcomes included sexual violence, violence in healthcare settings and reproductive coercion related to pregnancy, sterilisation and contraception. Displaced participants comprised WLHIV who were asylum seekers/refugees or internally displaced. Log binomial regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% CIs for associations between displacement and GBV outcomes. A total of 1062 cisgender WLHIV completed the questionnaire, among whom 144 (13.6%) were displaced. Displaced WLHIV had higher proportions of lifetime experience using drugs (66.7% vs 22.0%, p=<0.01), selling sex (28.5% vs 12.2%, p=<0.01) and facing HIV-related stigma/discrimination (47.9% vs 34.4%, p=<0.01). Displaced WLHIV were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual violence (aPR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.67 to 4.51), violence in healthcare (aPR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.49 to 4.43), pregnancy coercion (aPR: 2.60, 95% CI: 1.41 to 4.78), sterilisation coercion (aPR: 4.26, 95% CI: 1.17 to 15.43) and contraception coercion (aPR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.00 to 6.15) compared with non-displaced WLHIV. As the war in Ukraine continues, humanitarian and health systems can use these findings to guide integration of GBV referrals and scale-up of trauma-informed care and antiexploitation training into Ukrainian programming. Moreover, additional surveillance methods, including community-led monitoring, can support routine documentation of experiences of coercion and abuse in healthcare settings. Broadly, transformative approaches are needed to tackle structural causes of gender inequality, HIV and violence. ÃÂ© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Electronic address: shl9032@med.cornell.edu. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common hair loss type in women, but topical minoxidil is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment option. The pathophysiology involves shortened anagen phases, lengthened telogen phases, and hair follicle miniaturization. Androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a crucial role in male AGA pathogenesis, but their exact role in female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is unclear. Oral anti-androgens demonstrate some efficacy in women, albeit with considerations for side effects and contraindications. Topical anti-androgens may be used in combination with topical minoxidil or as alternatives to oral medications, likely with fewer systemic adverse effects. Patient-specific factors, including age, signs of hyperandrogenism, or need for contraception may help determine which anti-androgen therapy is most appropriate. This review focuses on current anti-androgen treatments for FPHL available in the US and their limitations, as well as emerging treatments that are investigational, studied in other hair loss types, or available in other countries.

    "To analyze awareness and perceptions related to self-managed abortion in Ohio after Dobbs and subsequent changes in Ohio abortion law. We analyzed data from the most recent wave (September 2022 to August 2023) of the Ohio Survey of Women, a cross-sectional survey of a population-representative sample of women aged 18-44 years in Ohio (full sample N=2,473). Our variables of interest were awareness of self-managed medication abortion (SMMA) and perceptions of self-managed abortion (SMA). Respondents were considered to have awareness of SMMA if they reported having heard of pills they can buy and use at home to conduct an abortion without going to a clinic or consulting a doctor. All respondents were also asked to indicate methods that they understand to mean SMA. A plurality (41.6%) of respondents were aware of SMMA. Non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic Asian women had less awareness of SMMA compared to non-Hispanic White women (prevalence ratio PR=0.72, 95% confidence interval CI [0.54-0.95] and PR=0.45, 95% CI [0.26-0.77] respectively). When compared with women who hold a bachelor's degree or higher educational level, women with less than a high school education, those with a high school degree, and those with only some college had less awareness of SMMA (respectively, PR=0.58, 95% CI [0.36-0.94]; PR=0.71, 95% CI [0.58-0.86]; PR=0.78, 95% CI [0.68-0.88]). About 30.3% of women identified Plan B and 24.4% indicated herbs as methods of SMA. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight disparities in awareness of SMMA abortion in adult, reproductive-age women in Ohio.

    "The objective of this study was to assess alterations in vaginal microbiota and immune markers over the first three months following initiation of copper intrauterine device (copper IUD), levonorgestrel (LNG) implant, and intramuscular depot medroxyprogestone acetate (DMPA-IM). We included 162 participants from the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) trial, which enrolled healthy, HIV-negative women seeking contraception and randomized them to a copper IUD, LNG implant, or DMPA-IM. Microbiome and immune profiles in vaginal swab samples collected at enrollment, 1 month and 3 months were analyzed. We categorized microbiome profiles as 'optimal', 'intermediate', or 'non-optimal' based on established criteria [1]. We compared microbiome and immune markers across contraceptive groups and evaluated changes to 1 and 3 months. Copper IUD users had a more diverse vaginal microbiome and generally increased inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides over the 3-month follow-up, compared to LNG-implant and DMPA-IM users [2]. LNG-implant users had less complex vaginal microbiomes with reduced inflammation, while DMPA-IM showed little change in either microbiome composition or inflammatory markers. Copper IUD users exhibited lower microbiome stability and a higher likelihood of transitioning to less optimal profiles. In contrast, LNG-implant users showed greater stability and a higher probability of transition to optimal microbiome and immune marker profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Contraceptive methods affect the vaginal microbiome differently. Copper IUD use may lead to less favorable profiles and increased levels of some immune markers, indicating potential adverse health effects. Conversely, LNG-implant usage promotes a more favorable microbiome and immune marker balance. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that copper IUDs are associated with decreased prevalence of Lactobacillus-dominated microbiomes, higher transition rates towards less optimal microbiome and increased inflammatory profiles, which may lead to negative implications for gynecologic and reproductive health, the LNG-implant may offer positive health benefits with increased prevalence of L. crispatus-dominated microbiomes.

    "EC clients age 18-35y at four Utah family planning clinics between February 2021 and April 2023 initiated an ENG implant and completed follow-up surveys through 12-months. At 12 months, we accounted for 132 (82.5%) of 160 participants: 79 (59.8%) still used their implant and 53 (40.2%) discontinued. A higher proportion of privately-insured participants discontinued (42% vs. 24%, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 60% of participants who chose guideline-supported ENG implant placement at an EC clinical visit continued use at one year.

    "Contraceptive providers unnecessarily restrict contraceptive use or inappropriately apply medical eligibility criteria for a variety of reasons, including knowledge gaps, personal bias, or fear of legal or social consequences. As prevalence of these restrictions is unknown, this analysis aims to document current patterns of provider-imposed restrictions on contraceptive methods at public facilities in Western Kenya and assess novel questions on medical restrictions. We surveyed 345 family planning providers across all 137 public healthcare facilities in Kisumu County, Kenya in 2022. The survey asked about non-clinically-indicated provider restrictions placed on six contraceptive methods, including sociodemographic and medical restrictions on contraceptive use. We use descriptive statistics to present the self-reported proportion of providers who impose incorrect sociodemographic or medical restrictions and use Chi-squared tests to explore associations with provider gender, age, time since last family planning training, and facility level. We find that providers commonly imposed sociodemographic restrictions on female permanent contraception and intrauterine devices, with fewer providers inappropriately restricting women seeking oral contraceptive pills, implants, injections, or male condoms. Few providers reported accurately applying weight, blood pressure, or breastfeeding related medical eligibility criteria, with many inappropriately restricting hormonal methods. Weight was the most common reason for restriction, with 50% of providers reportedly applying inappropriate weight-based restrictions to oral contraceptive pills, 60% to injectables, and 40% to implants. CONCLUSIONS: Provider bias and inappropriate medical restrictions limit women's contraceptive choice in Kenya. More research is needed to address inappropriate provider restrictions, especially around patient age, weight, and partner consent. IMPLICATIONS: We find that providers are applying biased and/or inappropriate medical restrictions to contraceptive methods in Kisumu, Kenya, especially around patient weight. More research is needed to understand why many providers are applying medical eligibility criteria incorrectly, and how this impacts women's contraceptive choices. Copyright ÃÂ© 2025.

    "Hormonal therapy (HT) is widely administered for contraception and menopausal symptom management. However, its impact on psoriasis risk remains unclear, requiring an evaluation across diverse age groups to inform clinical practice and optimize treatment strategies. To investigate the association between HT and the risk of psoriasis in reproductive-age and postmenopausal women. This study utilized both nationwide cohort design and target trial emulation, analyzing data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database (2001-2021). Women over 20 years old without a prior history of psoriasis, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer were included, segmented into reproductive-age (Ã¢ÂÂ¤50 years) and postmenopausal (>50 years) groups. Women who initiated HT were assigned as the exposed group, while women without HT formed the comparison group. The primary outcome was the incidence of psoriasis over a five-year period. The study applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed to enhance the robustness of the findings. In the postmenopausal cohort, comprising 1,482,302 HT users and 1,313,799 nonusers, the IPTW-adjusted HR for psoriasis in the ITT analysis was 1.48 (95% CI 1.44-1.52). The PP analysis indicated a more pronounced risk, with an HR of 5.93 (95% CI 5.66-6.22). Among the reproductive-age cohort, which included 3,849,721 HT users and 1,585,461 nonusers, the IPTW-adjusted HR in the ITT analysis was 1.93 (95% CI 1.90-1.99). In the PP analysis, the risk increased, showing an HR of 7.85 (95% CI 7.56-8.15). These findings highlight the significantly elevated psoriasis risk associated with HT, especially in younger women. This study establishes an association between HT and an increased risk of psoriasis in both reproductive-age and postmenopausal women using a nationwide cohort design and target trial emulation. These findings further highlight the potential influence of hormonal factors on psoriasis development. Clinicians should remain attentive to early signs of psoriasis in women receiving HT to ensure timely recognition and management. ÃÂ© The Author(s) 2025.

    "Effective family planning interventions may have inadvertent effects on births of girls given son preference in India. We conducted 36 and 48-month follow-ups to our CHARM2 family planning study to determine long-term intervention effects on births and sex of children. Our non-blinded two-armed cluster RCT randomized young married couples (NÃÂ =ÃÂ 1201 couples) from 20 geographic clusters (60-61 couples per cluster) into either the CHARM2 intervention or control (referral to local care) condition. CHARM2 offers 5-session gender-synchronized family planning and gender equity counseling delivered by trained local medical providers. Data were collected at baseline in September 2018-June 2019 and then follow-ups at 9, 18, 36 and 48ÃÂ months, up to September 2023. We retained 88ÃÂ %-91ÃÂ % of women across follow-ups with no difference in retention by treatment group. We used adjusted mixed-effects logistic regression models examining sex composition of births at each follow-up and over the total 48-month follow-up to assess differences in all births of boys and girls by treatment group. We adjusted for treatment condition, cluster, and relevant demographics in adjusted models. We saw no treatment effects on total births or boy births, but lower likelihood of a girl birth was seen at 9-month follow-up and for the total 48-month follow-up period. We found at 9-month follow-up a girl birth was less likely for intervention compared with control participants (7.1ÃÂ % vs. 10.3ÃÂ %, respectively, pÃÂ =ÃÂ 0.06), and the male to female sex ratio of births born between baseline and 9-month follow-up was also significantly higher for intervention vs. comparison participants (1.50 [95ÃÂ % CI 1.00-2.26] vs. 0.83 [95ÃÂ % CI 0.56-1.21], pÃÂ =ÃÂ 0.04). We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine treatment effects on boy births and girl births over the 48-month follow-up and again found no effects on boy births, but a significantly lower likelihood of a girl birth for the intervention group (22ÃÂ % vs 29ÃÂ %, pÃÂ =ÃÂ 0.03). The CHARM2 family planning intervention, previously demonstrating significant effects on contraceptive use and women's reproductive agency in rural India, resulted in lower likelihood of girl births over time, suggesting that family planning programs can contribute to sex ratio imbalances if broader social changes eliminating son preference and improving value of a girl child do not occur.
