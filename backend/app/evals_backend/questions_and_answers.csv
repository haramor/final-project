Can IUDs move around in the body?,Rarely. IUDs can shift slightly but almost never travel beyond the uterus.,"{'answer': 'Yes, IUDs can move around in the body. According to the provided CONTEXT, IUD migration can lead to severe complications if undiagnosed and may present with pain or remain asymptomatic. Additionally, there are reports of ectopic IUDs in various organs, including the urinary bladder, suggesting that IUDs can migrate to other areas outside the uterus.\n\nSources used:\n\n* ""Delayed diagnosis of concurrent intrauterine and intraperitoneal intrauterine devices following assumed expulsion: A case report.""\n* ""Using laparoscope to remove an ectopic intrauterine device in the anterior wall of urinary bladder: A case report.""\n* ""[Intrauterine Device Totally Embedded in the Bladder Wall: Report of One Case].""\n* ""The Migration of an Intrauterine Device in the Bladder of an Asymptomatic Woman: A Case Report.""\n\nUnique source names:\n\n* Delayed diagnosis of concurrent intrauterine and intraperitoneal intrauterine devices following assumed expulsion: A case report\n* Using laparoscope to remove an ectopic intrauterine device in the anterior wall of urinary bladder: A case report\n* [Intrauterine Device Totally Embedded in the Bladder Wall: Report of One Case]\n* The Migration of an Intrauterine Device in the Bladder of an Asymptomatic Woman: A Case Report', 'sources': ['Delayed diagnosis of concurrent intrauterine and intraperitoneal intrauterine devices following assumed expulsion: A case report.', 'Using laparoscope to remove an ectopic intrauterine device in the anterior wall of urinary bladder: A case report.', 'Recent advancements and future applications of intrauterine drug delivery systems.', 'The Migration of an Intrauterine Device in the Bladder of an Asymptomatic Woman: A Case Report.', '[Intrauterine Device Totally Embedded in the Bladder Wall:Report of One Case].']}"
Does hormonal birth control protect against STIs?,No. Only condoms reduce STI risk.,"{'answer': 'Based on the provided context, the question ""Does hormonal birth control protect against STIs?"" can be answered as follows:\n\nThe answer to this question is somewhat complex. A systematic review and meta-analysis (Source: Hormonal contraceptive use and the risk of sexually transmitted infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis) found that there was a positive association between hormonal contraceptive methods/use and the risk of chlamydia, but a negative association for trichomoniasis and vaginosis. There was also no statistically significant association between hormonal contraceptive methods/use and gonorrhoea.\n\nHowever, it\'s important to note that the same review found that hormonal contraceptive use did not protect against all STIs equally, with the risk varying depending on the type of STI.\n\nIn summary, while hormonal birth control may have some protective effects against certain STIs, such as trichomoniasis and vaginosis, it does not provide complete protection against all types of STIs.\n\nSources used:\n\n1.

Do I need parental consent to get birth control as a teen?,It depends on the state. Some allow confidential access to minors.,"{'answer': ""Based on the provided context, it seems that the laws and regulations regarding minors' access to contraception without parental consent are complex and vary depending on the jurisdiction. In Israel, for example, the Israeli Legal Capacity and Guardianship Law denies minors the right to decide upon medical treatment, including contraception, without parental consent (Source: [PRESCRIBING CONTRACEPTIVES TO MINORS WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT]).\n\nIn Illinois, legislation allows adolescents to access comprehensive contraceptive care, but provider practices remain unclear (Source: Are Illinois Contraceptive Providers Comfortable Providing Care to Adolescents?). The same source notes that provider knowledge and comfort surrounding the provision of contraceptive care to adolescents are important predictors of practice.\n\nIt is not explicitly stated in the provided context whether parental consent is required for a teen to access birth control.

Can birth control improve PCOS symptoms?,Yes. Hormonal contraceptives regulate cycles and reduce androgens.,"{'answer': 'Based on the provided CONTEXT, birth control can improve PCOS symptoms in some ways. According to the article ""Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Common Questions and Answers"", oral contraceptives are first-line therapy for menstrual irregularities and dermatologic complications such as hirsutism and acne. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone are often added to oral contraceptives as second-line agents.\n\nAdditionally, the article ""A bitter pill to swallow: adjustments to oral contraceptive pill use in polycystic ovary syndrome"" emphasizes the importance of tailored therapies in women with PCOS, avoiding prescribing generalized or unsuitable therapies based on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nHowever, it\'s essential to note that not all birth control methods are suitable for all women with PCOS. The same article ""Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Common Questions and Answers"" mentions that metformin added to lifestyle management is first-line therapy for patients with metabolic complications such as insulin resistance.\n\nSources used:\n\n* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting women of childbearing age. Its complex pathophysiology includes genetic and environmental factors that contribute to insulin resistance in patients with this disease. The diagnosis of PCOS is primarily clinical, based on the presence of at least two of the three Rotterdam criteria: oligoanovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. PCOS is often associated with hirsutism, acne, anovulatory menstruation, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hormone-sensitive malignancies (e.g., at least a twofold increased risk of endometrial cancer). Lifestyle modification, including caloric restriction and increased physical activity, is the foundation of therapy. Subsequent management decisions depend on the patient\'s desire for pregnancy. In patients who do not want to become pregnant, oral contraceptives are first-line therapy for menstrual irregularities and dermatologic complications such as hirsutism and acne. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone are often added to oral contraceptives as second-line agents. In patients who want to become pregnant, first-line therapy is letrozole for ovulation induction. Metformin added to lifestyle management is first-line therapy for patients with metabolic complications such as insulin resistance. Patients with PCOS are at increased risk of depression and obstructive sleep apnea, and screening is recommended.\n* There is no validated tool to predict persistent ovulatory dysfunction after medication with oral contraceptives in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is the most severe subtype of PCOS. We aimed to build a model to predict persistent ovulatory dysfunction after medication of oral contraceptives in women with PCOS.\n* This Special Report aims to highlight the importance of tailored therapies in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), avoiding prescribing generalized or unsuitable therapies based on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n* Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder. This condition is characterized by chronic anovulation and ovarian dysfunction, unlike other ovulation disorders when the ovaries are non-functional or abnormal.&#xa0;Currently, most therapy is centred on the patient\'s primary complaint. Treatment focuses on reducing hyperandrogenism symptoms, restoring menstrual regularity, and achieving conception. In treating infertility caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome, letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) appears to be more successful than clomiphene citrate (an anti-estrogen and a reference infertility drug). When provided by a multidisciplinary team, it can help patients maintain appropriate lifestyle changes, such as reducing body fat, increasing metabolism, and enhancing reproductive health. Compound oral contraceptives are the most common kind of androgen inhibitor and are the preferred therapy for menstrual disruption in PCOS patients who do not want to get pregnant. Weight loss should be prioritized for women with PCOS since a healthy, balanced diet combined with regular exercise can boost metabolism, increase insulin sensitivity, and aid weight loss safely. This will improve their physical health. Other than reproductive symptoms, PCOS symptoms include insulin resistance (IR), metabolic syndrome (MS), and chronic low-grade inflammation.
